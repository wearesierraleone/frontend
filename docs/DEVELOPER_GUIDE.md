# Developer Quick Reference Guide

This quick reference guide covers the recent enhancements to the "We Are Sierra Leone" civic platform and provides guidelines for future development.

## Recent Platform Enhancements

### 1. Comment System Refactoring
- Implementation: See `js/reply-handler.js` and `js/post-loader.js` for the implementation
- Architecture: Separates reply handling functionality into a dedicated module for better maintainability
- Integration: Properly integrates with the post display system via updated post-loader.js
- Documentation: See changes documented in `CHANGES.md`

### 2. Expandable FAQ Section
- Implementation: See `faq.html` for the complete implementation
- Architecture: Uses semantic HTML with CSS transitions and JavaScript for interactivity
- Accessibility: Includes ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation support
- Documentation: See `/docs/ENHANCEMENTS.md` for technical details

### 3. Direct Petition Submission
- Implementation: See `post.html` for the updated petition creation flow
- API Endpoint: `/create-petition` (documented in `/docs/API_REFERENCE.md`)
- Local Testing: Enhanced server provides this endpoint for local development
- Documentation: See `/docs/ENHANCEMENTS.md` for comparison with previous implementation

## Best Practices for Future Enhancements

### Accessibility Guidelines
- Always include ARIA attributes for interactive elements
- Ensure keyboard navigability for all interactive components
- Maintain sufficient color contrast for text and UI elements
- Test with screen readers during development

### Code Style
- Use semantic HTML elements where appropriate
- Keep JavaScript functions small and focused
- Prefer CSS transitions over JavaScript animations when possible
- Document complex functionality with code comments

### Testing Workflow
1. Test locally using the enhanced server
2. Verify functionality across different browsers
3. Check responsiveness on mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
4. Validate accessibility using automated tools and manual testing

### Documentation Updates
When making changes to the platform, remember to update:
- Main `README.md` with feature summaries
- `/docs/README.md` with more detailed explanations
- `/docs/API_REFERENCE.md` for API changes
- `/docs/LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md` for local development workflow changes
- `/CHANGES.md` to document significant enhancements
- Create specialized documentation for complex features

## Server Endpoints Reference

- `/save-post` - Create new posts
- `/create-petition` - Create new petitions with direct submission
