# Post Submission Fix

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the issue with posts not being saved to approved.json.

## Problem

- New posts were being prepared correctly with "pending" status
- However, the post data wasn't actually being saved to the approved.json file
- The code was only logging to console: "Post would be saved with data"
- When using VS Code's Live Server (port 5500), there was a "Method Not Allowed" error

## Solution

1. **Enhanced Local Server**
   - Created `start_local_server_with_api.sh` which runs a Node.js server
   - Added a `/save-post` API endpoint to handle post saving to approved.json
   - Implemented proper error handling for file operations

2. **Updated Submit Process**
   - Modified `submit_post.js` to detect local development environment
   - Added code to send post data to the save-post API endpoint
   - Improved error messages to guide users when saving fails

3. **Admin Status Updates**
   - Updated admin.html to save status changes via the API
   - Added more helpful error messages when save API isn't available

## Usage

To use the new system:

1. Start the enhanced local server:
   ```
   ./scripts/start_local_server_with_api.sh
   ```

2. Access the site at the URL shown in the terminal (e.g., http://localhost:5500 or another available port)

3. Submit posts and approve them in the admin interface

## Testing

You can verify the fix by:

1. Submitting a new post from the submit.html page
2. Verifying the post was added to approved.json (with status="pending")
3. Using admin.html to change the post status to "approved"
4. Confirming the post appears on the homepage

## Known Limitations

- This local development solution only works when using the enhanced local server
- In GitHub Pages deployment, posts cannot be saved without a backend API
- The enhanced server requires Node.js to be installed
